# Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker
This project was completed as part of the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics internship. The goal was to build a comprehensive dashboard to analyze social media ad campaign data and evaluate key performance metrics.

# Project Overview
This project involved analyzing simulated ad campaign data to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The tracker is designed to help marketing teams monitor campaign effectiveness by visualizing performance, engagement, and other key metrics.

# The dashboard includes visualizations for:

Campaign performance across different platforms (e.g., Affiliate Marketing, Google Ads).

Demographics such as Social_Media by age and gender.

Geographical distribution of engagement (Count of ID by Country).

Key performance indicators like total clicks and conversions.

Breakdowns of engagement by interest groups.

# Skills Gained
Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Marketing analytics: Analyzing ad campaign data to understand campaign effectiveness.

Dashboard storytelling: Creating clear, compelling visualizations that communicate insights to business stakeholders.

Campaign optimization: Using data to identify areas for improving campaign performance.

# Tools Used
# Power BI: For data modeling, analysis, and building the interactive dashboard.

# Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets: For initial data cleaning and preparation (if applicable).

# How to Run the Dashboard
Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the FUTURE_DS_02.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.

The dashboard will automatically load, allowing you to interact with the visualizations and explore the data.
